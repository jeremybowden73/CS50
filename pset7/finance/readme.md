CS50x Problem Set 7

"C$50 Finance"

My code is all in the Python file application.py
but a good understanding of how the other elements of the (fake) website interact 
(SQL, Flask, JSON, HTML) is needed in order to complete the functions in the Python file.

For more information refer to CS50x documentation: https://docs.cs50.net/problems/finance/finance.html
