CS50x Problem Set 8

"Mashup"

My code is all in the Python file application.py and the Javascript file scripts.js, but a good understanding
of how the whole website operates (Google Maps APIs, SQL, jQuery, Flask, JSON) is needed in order to complete the functions in
these two files.

The .db file contains placenames information for the markers and search function.
