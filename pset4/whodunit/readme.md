CS50x Problem Set 4

"Whodunit" program in C.

Please note that although a full understanding of the whole program is required to complete the work,
the code I personally wrote is clearly marked between lines 80 and 92 of whodunit.c.
The remainder of the code is provided by the course provider.

For more information refer to CS50x documentation: https://docs.cs50.net/problems/whodunit/whodunit.html
